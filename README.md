## app.yaml

This is the file that grants us the ability to talk to GAE. The first line tells GAE which application we<br>
will be developing. The other lines in that first block of code tell GAE the environment in which we plan to<br>
develop. Everything else just tell GAE that we are using Django. It's a pretty simple file that we won't have to <br>
mess with that much

## Github Flow

Check out this link for a super - easy for how github works for use : [supa helpful stuff] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)<br>

The basic idea is this:<br>
1. Make a new branch<br>
2. Do work on that branch<br>
3. Issue a pull request<br>
4. Discuss the changes<br>
5. Merge it with the master branch
